            <h1>The story of an aspiration </h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>This page describes the thoughts and motivation behind the project 
            <i>peccon</i>. It is subdivided into three main themes: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Idea</b></li>
                <li><b>The Journey</b></li>
                <li><b>The end goal</b></li>
            </ul>
            The themes entail a thought process which makes this project viable. 
            The story helps the builders organize all the necessary input on each theme and by consequence gives them a clear overview on 
            what they want to achieve, how to get there and how it in the end should look like. The story is therefore not written for anyone but the builders. 
            It is as it were a guideline to not lose track on what really matters. The nice to have is that everyone involved in the project is up to date 
            on the future developments. If you want to be part of the project feel free to contact me on the following address:

            <h2>The idea</h2>
            The idea behind the project stems mainly from personal frustrations on the current financial system. 
            Reading books like Capital in the 21ste century, The Black Swan and Thinking Fast and Slow provides
            your brain with some thinking material about how a household should organize their financial situation. 
            If the current affairs of the financial world continuous, the main financial well-being of average households will deteriorate. 
            This is caused by several issues that have long-term implication on the wealth distribution in our society, but the main concept
            underlying all of these, is that money creates money. someone who owns 500 million euros can optimize his return of 3.5% by 
            hiring a financial expert which in return gives him a return of 5%. Also, 3.5% of 500 million is 175 000 euros, 
            while the same return for a capital of 50 000 euros will only generate 1750 euros. The first person can easily live of
            his money while the last person can only substitute one month of salary. In the end this inequality will only increase proportional until 
            the last person cannot pay his bills.  If we follow this logic and just perpetuate through time
            then eventually one person will hold 99% of the money. Now this has never happened mainly because of two reasons: economic shocks that 
            disturb the wealth accumulation in society and the nature of human beings which is more then often irrational. 
            In a sense the economic shocks are a paradox as economic inequality creates social unrest which in turn leads to economic shocks 
            that then leads to redistribution of wealth. It is a vicious cycle where people in the bottom of society have to 
            suffer before any changes to the system are applied. There are many examples in many forms in history and in the 21ste century we
            have come a long way of making our society more eligatary. Our current society already has systems in place where
            redistribution of wealth happens. The main tool for redistribution of wealth are taxes. As 10% of 500 million 
            is 50 million while for 50 000 it is 5 000.  Taxes are the reverse of returns they set the clock straight.
            How these taxes should be applied and how to invest this money, is the debacle of many debates but one kind 
            of taxes nobody dares speaking of. The taxes on heritage
