            <h1>The story of an aspiration </h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>This page describes the thoughts and motivation behind the project 
            <i>peccon</i>. It is subdivided into three main themes: The Idea, The Journey and The end goal. 
            The themes entail a thought process which makes this project viable. 
            More precisely, The story helps the builders organize all the necessary input on each theme and 
            by consequence gives them a clear overview on what they want to achieve, how to get there and 
            how it in the end should look like. The story is therefore written for the builders. 
            It is as it were a guideline to not lose track on what really matters.
            The nice to have is that everyone involved in the project is up to date 
            on the main drivers, future developments and possible different scenario's of the project.
            If you want to be part of the project, feel free to contact me on the following address:
            Changes to the story can be made throughout each development phase as to adjust for new information. 
            </p>
            <h2>The idea</h2>
            <p>
            The idea behind the project stems mainly from personal frustrations on the current financial system. 
            Reading books like Capital in the 21ste century, The Black Swan and Thinking Fast and Slow provides
            your brain with some thinking material about how a household should organize their financial situation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If the current affairs of the financial world continuous, the main financial well-being of average households will deteriorate. 
            This is caused by several issues that have long-term implication on the wealth distribution in our society, but the main concept
            underlying all of these, is that money creates money. someone who owns 500 million euros can optimize his return of 3.5% by 
            hiring a financial expert which in return gives him a profit of 5%. Also, 3.5% of 500 million is 175 000 euros, 
            while the same return for a capital of 50 000 euros will only generate 1750 euros. The first person can easily live of
            his money while the last person can only substitute one month of salary. 
            In the end this inequality will only increase proportional until the first person owns so much money that this influences the prices
            of goods such that the last person cannot pay his bills.  
            If we follow this logic and just perpetuate through time then eventually one person will hold 99% of the money.
            </p>
            <p> Now this has never happened mainly because of two reasons: economic shocks that 
            disturb the wealth accumulation in society and the nature of human beings. 
            In a sense the economic shocks are a paradox as economic inequality creates social unrest which in turn leads to economic shocks 
            that then leads to redistribution of wealth. It is a vicious cycle where people in the bottom of society have to 
            suffer before any changes to the system are applied. There are many examples in many forms in history and in the 21ste century we
            have come a long way of making our society more eligatary. Our current society already has systems in place where
            redistribution of wealth happens. The main tool for redistribution of wealth are taxes. As 10% of 500 million 
            is 50 million while for 50 000 it is 5 000.  Taxes are the reverse of returns they set the clock straight.
            How these taxes should be applied and how to invest this money, is the debacle of many debates but one kind 
            of tax is for the majority off limits: <b> The taxes on heritage </b>. 
            <p>Heritage is truly a creator of wealth inequality as wealth can easily accumulates if it can grow through generations. 
                For example, let's assume the following facts. A man in his mid-twenties is investing his capital of 50 000 with a real return of 5% each year.
                He does not use this capital and dies at the age of 85 year. His son eventually inherit his capital at the age of 30 and manages to get the same return. 
                Eventually his son inherits the capital at the age of 55 when his dad is also 85 years old. What do you think the total amount is after 121 years? 
                It is 180 million euros. This is an exuberant amount, but we never see this happen. Why is that? 
                It is nicely described in the following saying that speaks to the economic fallacy of enabling this wealth accumulation:
                Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.
                Loosely translated it means that the first generation creates the wealth, the second one manages it and the last one loses it 
                (give some reference studies that confirm this). The main issue here is that capital is inefficiently allocated for two generations as the second 
                and third generation will not use this money to get the same return as the first generation.
                Money that does not move in an economy is dead weight that slows economic growth (reference confirm). 
            The economic incentives for the last two generation to be productive and contribute to society is almost non-existing.
            It is hard to blame them for being unproductive as they have already acquired the necessary funds to live a decent life.
            From an economical perspective it is therefore unfavorable to allow this generational wealth accumulation. 
            </p> <p>Not only from an economical perspective, but also from a societal perspective is generational wealth an issue.  
            Imagine that everyone has a weight on what should be produced in the economy and that people with more money have higher weights to
            dictates what kind of products should be produced. If a small amount of people have a lot of money, they will shift their weights on 
            products which are less relevant for the rest. Creating a direct competition in resources between 
            the products which are necessary for a a lot of people and the unnecessary products which are important for a small group. 
            Status and image are all part of this inefficiency and do not really contribute to economic productivity, 
            but it sways the human mind and it nicely fits in our tribal struggle for power.  
            A more important effect of generational wealth is generational inequality. Children of rich parents tend to earn more 
            then the children from poor families. Generational wealth stops therefore the social movement between social classes 
            as it limits the ability of the lower classes to compete with the resources of higher classes.
            If generational inequality happens over a couple of generations then it becomes de facto the social inequality of our society 
            and we exchange a society based on merits with a society based on class. Our history is filled with examples of this process. (give some references)
            </p>
            <p>
            But note that it is not capital itself that creates this unfair society but rather the way we organize capital that enables 
            the shift from a society of merits to a society of standing. pushing the right capital incentives defines cultural and
            economic values. Capital should therefore push inequality within a generation with the goal to increase productivity, 
            but it should never increase the inequality from one generation to the next.  </p>
            
            <p>By applying a capital seeling on heritage you create a social net for 
            future generation and keep the social inequality in check 
            (what to do with money gained from the tax inefficient government equals inefficient capital).  
            This would be the ideal situation, but once we try to implement this tax it 
            becomes painstakingly clear that it is impossible to enforce it. 
            An international agreement should be made between all the countries in the world to enforce this tax as capital 
            does not know any boundaries. It flows like water: where there is the least resistant it will go. 
            Then it becomes a prisoner dilemma between countries and every economists knows how that ends. 
            It is therefore that I have build this website. It is, as every economy is, a social experiment in 
            which we try to see how capital incentives could push a society of merits instead of standing. 
            To do this I have set out a road-map on how the website should evolve throughout each stage. 
            More on that in the next theme
