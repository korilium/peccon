            <h1>The story of an aspiration </h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>This page describes the thoughts and motivation behind the project 
            <i>peccon</i>. It is subdivided into three main themes: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Idea</b></li>
                <li><b>The Journey</b></li>
                <li><b>The end goal</b></li>
            </ul>
            The themes entail a thought process which makes this project viable. 
            The story helps the builders organize all the necessary input on each theme and by consequence gives them a clear overview on 
            what they want to achieve, how to get there and how it in the end should look like. The story is therefore not written for anyone but the builders. 
            It is as it were a guideline to not lose track on what really matters. The nice to have is that everyone involved in the project is up to date 
            on the future developments. If you want to be part of the project feel free to contact me on the following adress:

            <h2>The idea</h2>
            The idea behind the project stems mainly from personal frustrations on the current financial systems. 
            Reading books like Capital in the 21ste century, The black Swan and Thinking Fast and Slow really gives your brain some thinking material.
            It mainly let's you question how the current financial world operates and how without anyone pulling strings the system 
            equilibrium is far from the equalitarian society that is based on merits and not  .
